# API Configuration
# SECURITY: API spreadsheet ID is configured via local.properties or environment variable
# Methods to configure API_SPREADSHEET_ID:
#   1. Add to local.properties (recommended for local development):
#      API_SPREADSHEET_ID=YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE
#   2. Set as environment variable:
#      export API_SPREADSHEET_ID=YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE
#   3. For CI/CD, set in pipeline environment variables
#
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
# - Never commit real spreadsheet IDs to version control
# - Use different IDs for development, staging, and production
# - Rotate spreadsheet IDs regularly
# - Restrict API access to specific email addresses/IP ranges
# - Enable audit logging on Google Sheets API
#
# To use different spreadsheet per build variant, override in buildTypes section:
#   buildTypes {
#       debug {
#           buildConfigField "String", "API_SPREADSHEET_ID", "\"DEBUG_SHEET_ID\""
#       }
#       release {
#           buildConfigField "String", "API_SPREADSHEET_ID", "\"PRODUCTION_SHEET_ID\""
#       }
#   }
