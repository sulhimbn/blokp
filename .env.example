# Docker Environment
# Set to "true" or "1" to use mock API endpoints (for Docker/local development)
# Leave unset or set to "false" to use production API endpoints

# API Configuration
# SECURITY: API spreadsheet ID is configured via local.properties or environment variable
# Methods to configure API_SPREADSHEET_ID:
#   1. Add to local.properties (recommended for local development):
#      API_SPREADSHEET_ID=YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE
#   2. Set as environment variable:
#      export API_SPREADSHEET_ID=YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE
#   3. For CI/CD, set in pipeline environment variables
#
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
# - Never commit real spreadsheet IDs to version control
# - Use different IDs for development, staging, and production
# - Rotate spreadsheet IDs regularly
# - Restrict API access to specific email addresses/IP ranges
# - Enable audit logging on Google Sheets API
#
# To use different spreadsheet per build variant, override in buildTypes section:
#   buildTypes {
#       debug {
#           buildConfigField "String", "API_SPREADSHEET_ID", "\"DEBUG_SHEET_ID\""
#       }
#       release {
#           buildConfigField "String", "API_SPREADSHEET_ID", "\"PRODUCTION_SHEET_ID\""
#       }
#   }
#
# API Base URLs
# Production API base URL (default: https://api.apispreadsheets.com/data/)
# Methods to configure PRODUCTION_BASE_URL:
#   1. Add to local.properties: PRODUCTION_BASE_URL=YOUR_PRODUCTION_URL
#   2. Set as environment variable: export PRODUCTION_BASE_URL=YOUR_PRODUCTION_URL
#   3. If not configured, defaults to https://api.apispreadsheets.com/data/
#
# Mock API base URL for testing (default: https://api-mock:5000/data/)
# Methods to configure MOCK_BASE_URL:
#   1. Add to local.properties: MOCK_BASE_URL=YOUR_MOCK_URL
#   2. Set as environment variable: export MOCK_BASE_URL=YOUR_MOCK_URL
#   3. If not configured, defaults to https://api-mock:5000/data/
#
# Certificate Pinning
# Certificate pins for HTTPS security (comma-separated SHA256 hashes)
# Methods to configure CERTIFICATE_PINNER:
#   1. Add to local.properties: CERTIFICATE_PINNER=pin1;pin2;pin3
#   2. Set as environment variable: export CERTIFICATE_PINNER=pin1;pin2;pin3
#   3. If not configured, uses default pins (extracted on 2026-01-08)
#
# Certificate Pinning Best Practices:
# - Extract current pins using: openssl s_client -connect api.apispreadsheets.com:443 -showcerts
# - Always have at least 2 backup pins for rotation
# - Rotate pins before certificates expire (typically 1-2 years)
# - Test pin rotation in staging environment first
# - Monitor certificate expiration alerts
# - Document pin rotation dates in security audit trail
